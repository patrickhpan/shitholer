        "Donald Trump referred to Haiti, El Salvador, and nations in Africa as “shithole countries”, asking: “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?”",
        "Trump has since denied the remarks, but he's said that Nigerian immigrants would never “go back to their huts.” That's particularly ironic because, according to Bloomberg, immigrants from Nigerian are significantly better-educated and higher-earning than median Americans.",
        "Whether your ancestors came to America centuries ago or you stepped foot on American soil for the first time yesterday, you might've come from a country that Donald Trump thinks is a shithole. Not that it should matter. America is for the tired, the poor, the  wretched refuse of the teeming shore, and everyone is welcome.",
        "My parents came to America from China and Taiwan, which were “shithole countries” in not-too-distant memory, and enough hard work and good luck along the way helped them achieve success in this country. Their story is identical to those of so many Americans from shithole countries over the years, and we shitholers have helped build this nation from its first day.",
        "Donald Trump may not think that people like you or me from shithole countries belong in America, but I'm proud to be a shitholer."
